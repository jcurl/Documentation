# About Me

My name is Jason Curl. I am a software Engineer and started in the Automotive
industry writing C and 68k assembly in 1999 on 7MHz embedded processors (similar
to the processor in the original Palm Pilot). I've held roles of software
programmer, software technical lead, requirements engineer, applications
engineer and technical project lead.

The pages in this repository are just random thoughts on a particular day which
interest me. They are not intended for anyone or anything. I collect them
through my own experiences and reading the various blogs on [Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) which has a wealth of information from
people in similar professions, with similar problems to me.

I am currently in Germany working for a large Automotive OEM, having worked for
Automotive suppliers previously.
