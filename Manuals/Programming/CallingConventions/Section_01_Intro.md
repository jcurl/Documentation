# Introduction

Calling conventions are the rules that allow different software components,
written by different software vendors, potentially using different compilers or
different languages, to interface with one another.

In this paper you'll find examples of how compilers implement the calling
conventions. It does not replace the standards themselves. There is a lot of
information on the Internet but unfortunately, some of the terminology used is
not clear (ordering left to right, or right to left), they lack significant
details (variable argument lists, structures, floats) or need examples.

The code examples presented are in C. The output is disassembled by various
tools, dependent on the system thatâ€™s being run. For example, the `dumpbin.exe`
tool is used for Microsoft generated objects. On Unix type systems the tool
`objdump` is used.
