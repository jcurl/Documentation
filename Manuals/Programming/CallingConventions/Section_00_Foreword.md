# Software Calling Conventions - Foreword

I wrote this document initially in October 2012 using LaTeX. I was motivated by
how to implement a calling convention in assembly, so I could write functions in
assembly and link with my C libraries. The work was for my
[RJCP.DLL.CpuId](https://github.com/jcurl/RJCP.DLL.CpuId) project.

Now 10 years have passed, and I'd like to publish my original work. As part of
that effort, I wanted to convert it to Markdown format, which has become
immensely popular with the usage of [GitHub](https://github.com/) and
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) for rendering within the browser. The
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor makes it easy to
write markdown with its preview mode and various plugins. Tools such as
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) make great strides in making markdown a
publishable format.

By all means, I wouldn't call it professional, but sufficiently good enough to
support myself in my own work.

Since this document was first written, Linux distributions are now generally
64-bit and ARM processors have become more ubiquitous for mainstream use. Work
may be extended later to include more information.
